## Tech / framework used

The current stack of this project is :

- Frontend side :

  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) as a framework for the client interface
  - [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) as a css framework based on Flexbox

- Backend side :
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the API server and the application server
  - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the client / server exchanges
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/en) as database

## Getting started

These instructions explain how to run a local instance of Emendare for development, but also how to build the application for production.

### Prerequisites

To set up the project, you must have **Node.js** installed.
To install Node.js, please refer to the [Node.js official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You can optionnaly install Docker-Compose to start more easily the Mongo database.
To install Docker-Compose, please refer to the [Docker Compose official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

The installation of the project requires 2 steps: a configuration of the server and another of the client.

#### Server configuration

The first step will be to create the MongoDB database. To do so, just create a docker container with a Mongo image, following the steps below.

```bash
cd server/
```

then create the Mongo image :

```bash
docker-compose build
```

> This 'build' command must only be entered during installation.

you can finaly run the container :

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The database is accessible at the following address: **localhost: 27017 / emendare**.

Once the database is set up, the dependencies can be installed :

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the server either for production :

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or for development (run these commands in two separates terminals) :

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

These commands will start the server at the following address : **localhost:3030**

#### Client configuration

To run the client, the first step will be to install the dependencies.

```bash
cd client/
npm install
```

The client can now be started in two modes :

- in development :

```bash
npm run dev
```

- in production :

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The app.js server will allow http redirection to https as well as Gzip compression of the application files.
